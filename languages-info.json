      "description": "C# (pronounced C-Sharp) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is mainly used for building Windows applications, web applications, and games. C# is known for its strong typing, good performance, and ease of use, especially for developers working with the .NET framework.",
      "history": "C# was developed by Microsoft in the late 1990s as part of the .NET initiative. The language was led by Anders Hejlsberg, a well-known software engineer. C# was officially released in 2000 with the first version of the .NET Framework. It was designed to be a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe language, combining the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic. Since then, C# has evolved significantly with new versions introducing features like LINQ, async/await, generics, and more, making it popular for desktop applications, web development, and game development (especially with Unity).",
